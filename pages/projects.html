			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidrandallmiller"
				>@davidrandallmiller</a
			>, and
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3Blue1Brown">@3Blue1Brown</a>,
			I've wanted to build something like this for a long time My BTech
			final project felt like the perfect excuse to finally do it. So,
			here's TheLifeOfPy, my attempt at creating a simple artificial life
			simulation software where you can create organisms by customizing
			their phenotypic and genotypic traits (like neural networks, size,
			color, and defense mechanisms) and release them into an environment
			to see how they interact. P.S. If you liked the project, a ‚≠ê would
			mean a lot.

		<p>
			After being tired of writing test@example.com in every project or
			asking ChatGPT for realistic insert queries, I built DataSmith, a
			free cross-platform app to generate realistic SQL data with almost
			no setup. It auto-detects your DB schema, supports Faker, regex,
			Python, FKs, and can export .sql or insert directly. Started as a
			CLI tool: 
			<code class="glow"
				><span class="hidden">projects</span> DataForge</code
			>, it evolved into a GUI app as I figured others might find it
			useful too.

		<p>
			My first Reinforcement Learning project,
			<strong>GridNavigatorRE</strong> is a simple grid navigator that
			uses the DQN algorithm in a custom environment to train an agent to
			navigate to a fixed goal while avoiding obstacles on the path. I've
			worked for months on this project and it was pretty rewarding to see
			the agent stop hitting at the first obstacle it sees and finally
			navigate to the target.

			&emsp; Comes from the words "Health" and "Genie",
			<strong>Healie</strong> is a personal health assistant that we built
			for a Hackathon, the project actually went on to win
			<b>"Best AI/ML project"</b> in the competition. It's supposed to
			work like a health assistant that you can upload your health
			diagnosis and test data into, from where it would provide a
			secondary opinion regarding your treatments, we thought such a
			project would be important because medical misdiagnosis happen all
			the time.
		</p>

		<p>
			&emsp; Tldr; The project helps doctors in making better choices and
			patients in being better educated of their treatments and medicines.

		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp;It's a Python tool I built to auto-generate and insert

			with this project! Hope you find it helpful too.

		<p>
			One of my first android app, <strong>ZTLAB</strong> is a

			any of them, but the attendance part. Given that it only has a major
			set back of taking around a solid
			<strong>minute and half </strong>to load up due to the usage of a
			free server to run on. Proving that there's a ton of work left to
			do, maybe later...
		</p>
		<p>
			Though, given it's numerous shortcomings, I still learned a lot
			making it.
